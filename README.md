# scripts

This repository contains scripts that have been useful to me when 
working with CDK

cdk-install-stage1.sh	- start install
cdk-start.sh		- start vagrant
cdk-install-stage2.sh	- complete install
bash_profile		- custom .bash_profile, which preserves original
dircolors.xterm		- colors for '/bin/ls --color'
prompt_set		- sets PS1 (variable containing prompt) to a colorful 4-liner
